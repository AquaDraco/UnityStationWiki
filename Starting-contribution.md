# First thing first
***

## Downloading unity :
* [Unity personal edition](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal),
Just check the little box and download the installer, it's a , at some point, you'll have to make an account, but that doesn't need any explaining.

**Note that you should use Unity 2017.2 or later.**

  *  **Keeping unity updated**:
      Since unity is updated from time to time, there is a need to update the client, but worry not, theres a nice little button in the _Help_ tab of the client.

## Downloading the repository :
* [Here is a helpful guide on how to GIT ](https://github.com/unitystation/unitystation/wiki/GIT-basics), But if you wouldn't touch GIT desktop with a 10 foot stick, and you just want to mess around with the current state of the project, just go ahead and download a [.ZIP of the repository](https://codeload.github.com/unitystation/unitystation/zip/develop)

For contribution however, using GIT is a requirement and not an option!

   * **Opening the repository** :
So now that you have downloaded unity and the repo, press _open_ and just browse to where you put it, be it through GIT or the direct link.

First import will take some time.

After import is finished, you can open scenes: Select `File > Open Scene`, navigate to `Scenes` folder and open a scene (map) of your liking.
