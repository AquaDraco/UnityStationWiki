Light2D is a plugin that has been used in a test for creating a better (and more realistic) lighting system. There are however a few things that need to be changed before it can be put back in on a release or pre-release(develop) version:

* It currently has its own folder /assets/Light2D when using DirectX it calls the shaders relative to this path
* It's kinda heavy on the client
* It has some shadow/light bleed issues
* The plugin is basically abandonware
