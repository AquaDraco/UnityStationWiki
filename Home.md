**Welcome to unitystation. An open source effort to clone the [/TG/station](www.tgstation13.org) branch to unity.**

As this project is in its early stages, this wiki will serve the purpose of providing a foundation and a almost (not) up-to-date scripting reference to the underlying structure of unitystation.
