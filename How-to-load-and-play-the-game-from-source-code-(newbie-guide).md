## How to GET IN THE GAME

## by Schneckenhof


#### OK. Listen up Recruit ! 

Congratulations, you went through the ~~convoluted @ss~~ process of getting GitHub and authorized your account via email. 

Then you downloaded Unity Hub and Unity by ~~signing a sworn affidavit in blood that you are a poor schmuck who doesn't have a six figure salary, ya poor pleb~~ using their premier "downloading process".

Finally you are ready to load up the Epic Curse Breaking Version of Space Station 13 on the Unity Engine. 

You load up the project and are greeted by what looks an 8th graders homework assignment in Microsoft access...with a weird immortal space clown mocking you with space cartwheels. 

Where did this project go wrong? All that work. It must be the curse. 

Its CURSED! 

## :japanese_ogre:

0 out of 10, cursed project, would not play again. The The End.

Well Good for you! We don't want your lazy butt. But since you're new here, I will let you in on a sekrit. 

#### You're only 90% done. 

But you're not there yet. Contrary to popular belief you didn't screw up, and the project isn't dead. You just need to do a few tweaks and you will be well on your way to joining this station before it falls into the sun, or cuthulu devours your soul, .....whichever comes first. 

Here's how you get there. Don't worry, I know you can't read, or probably code, thats why you're assigned to be a ~~guinea pig~~ ...ahem..."valued new recruit" on this ~~hell hole~~ Prototype station. 

**Don't Panic**, I took pictures. 

After all, these old hats are used to having everything set up perfectly and it doesn't always work to us newbies.  

I remember my first day trying to join the station crew like it was yesterday **(*Because it was*)**. I loaded up unity station and I see what looks like two windows showing the outside of the space station. Most of them have what appears to be design elements. 
One window is somewhat zoomed out with what appears to be a login screen. The other window seemed super zoomed in. I had no idea what I was even looking at. I asked in the comms (*discord*) how do I arrive at the station and I was told to "just hit play". Ok. I do that. Music plays, maybe a sound effect goes off. I see a clown float by in space. And **NOT A **~~DANG~~** Darn (Christian Server :neckbeard: :anger:) THING ELSE HAPPENS**. 


#### Here's how to fix that.

(Note To Self, learn to do a pull request and Fix Images)

Starting from the point where you load the project from unity hub, here's how you get "In Game".

Note that I am loading the project with **Unity Version 2018.3.14f1**
from the Unity Hub launcher. 
I don't know if that is important but I made it bold anyways.

The unity loading screen appears with the logo and multicolored strands of fiber i guess.

When it loads you're going to have two grid like screens on the left. The top one will say "scene" on the tab. The bottom one will say "game"
Then on the right theres some menus that say things like "hiearchy" "project" and "inspector"
I don't know what any of that **Christian Server** does. 
It frankly doesn't matter if you're just trying to get in game.

Under the bottom gridlike screen that says "game" (I think it looks like it has a packman beside the word game). There's a few sub menus. 

They are: 

Display 1, Free Aspect, Scale (with like a sliding scale) MAXIMIZE ON PLAY, Mute Audio, Stats, Gizmos.

**You want to make sure "MAXIMIZE ON PLAY" is pressed.**

Then go hit the Triangle play button at the Vertical Top of the screen, middle horizontally.

This will make all these UI elements look less like the back end of a database program and more like they would appear in the end product.

Then you are presented with a mockup of a login screen.

Login

It will say like Cuban Pete or some other Bullshit.
Then you accept defaults and click 'start game'

### Here's the pictures as promised:

##### Menu as soon as you load up the project

Make sure Maximize on Play is selected.

Then Hit the Play button at the top of your screen in the middle.
Hit login

##### Choose a side. I don't think it matters. I just go with station crew.

## :video_game:

I hope that helps. Now go and figure out who stabbed Mr. Bubbles, and wrap up this Monkey Murder Mystery before the space station falls into the sun or something.

## :speak_no_evil::shipit::sunny:

For Those to Lazy to read: Make sure the "Maximize on Play" button is selected and pressed down before you actually hit play.

## The End
