## Intro
To contribute to UnityStation, you need to learn how to submit what we call a "Pull Request" or "PR" in short. this is a request from you, to request the staff to add your changes to our repository.

Below you'll find a shorty and simple picture guide to submit a PullRequest, granted you already have the changes on a branch of your own Github Repository

## Method 1
**_When you get a yellow bar at the unitystation project root_**
Then you click "Compare and Pull Request" here:

You fill in this form:

You can checkmark the questions by using an X instead of the space:

When done you can click "Create Pull Request"

## Method 2
**_When you do not get a yellow bar at the unitystation project root_**
If you don't get the big semi-yellow bar, you can click on "new pullrequest":
