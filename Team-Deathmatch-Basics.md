## This guide is meant for version 0.2.2 and not the current release

## Intro
The current gameplay mode is a Team Deathmatch in which the departments fight for who is boss.
The captain, being the jackass he is, joined the graytide and the rest of the departments can drink eachothers blood!

Fight your way to glory, for you and your department. Whichever department gets the most kills, within 6 minutes, wins! "But ey I just want to grief" don't worry, if you kill your teammate or yourself, you will not only annoy them bigtime, but also give your team negative scorepoints, ain't that fun! 👍
