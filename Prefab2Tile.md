Prefab2tile is a tool made to create tiles for all object prefabs under /Resources/Prefabs/Objects. This due to the insane number of objects that will come into existence during the course of this project.

It also makes sure preview sprites are generated, unused preview sprites are deleted and tiles without prefab get deleted.

## Usage instructions: 

Using this tool is simple:
* In the top window, select “Tools/Prefab2Tile”. 
* Wait till finished. ..
