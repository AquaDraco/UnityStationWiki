This subsection will be describing Space Station 13 construction, TG's to be exact. **[WIP]**
***
_Of course, this is not to be copied exactly while making a feature for Unity Station, it is only a description of the current system._


## Basic materials:

![](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/1/15/Glass.png) **Glass**
![](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/e/eb/Glass_r.png) **Reinforced glass**

**Function:**

These are basic material stacks, any one of them can exist individually or in a stack of 2O.


**Notes:**

-sprite doesn't change, just a value that you can see by examining or clicking.

-can be split said stack by click it with a non active hand slot selected.

**Possible implementation:**

To be kept the same way but with a visual queue of the quantity of material at the corner of the item slot, would only show on the UI to avoid clutter.

## Rudimentary construction/crafting:

**Function:**

Whatever you can construct without using tools or other steps, the most basic construction type.

**Notes:** 

-You access this menu by clicking said material stack with it in your active hand slot.

-By clicking an option, the item appears under your character.

-Some options have multipliers, to help speed up the process of making multiple items, ie: metal rods from metal sheets
