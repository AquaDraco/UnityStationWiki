## This guide is meant for version 0.2.2 and not the current release

## Intro
Before Nanotrasen made this death trap of a station, and put brothers against each others in a murderous game, they have implanted all crew members with implants that turn proteins and other nutrients into nanomachines that instantly heal wounds, and where can you find proteins ?

## STEAK!
For that sweet, sweet medium rare steak, you'll have to butcher any non-human [mob](https://github.com/unitystation/unitystation/wiki/Mobs) on the map using a knife (or a screwdriver for some reason), then you'll have to cook it inside one of the several Nanotrasen certified microwaves.
