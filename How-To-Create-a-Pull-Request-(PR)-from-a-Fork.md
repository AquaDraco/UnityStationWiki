Step 1: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right. It should be right below your profile picture on the upper right.

Step 2: Once you press "Fork", Github will proceed to create your own copy of Unitystation's files.

Step 3: After Github completes creating the copy, you will be taken to your newly created "fork" of Unitystation! You may notice that it says "This branch is even with unitystation:develop." Essentially, this means that your version of the files are identical to the main files for Unitystation.

Step 4: At this point, you will be able to locate and edit any file within any of Unitystation's directories. For the purpose of this guide, I edited a random line of code in a file, as a demonstration.

Step 5: Once you have finished your edits, you can "Commit" (save) your changes to your development branch by selecting the circled option, then clicking "Commit changes"

Step 6: After you commit your changes, go BACK to the main Github page for Unitystation and click "New Pull Request".

Step 7: Once you click "New Pull Request", you will see a teensy, weensy, highlighted hyperlink titled, "Compare Across Forks." Click it. Now.

Step 8: Upon clicking "Compare Across Forks", you will see two new options pop up. Click on the drop-down menu highlighted in the picture below and select your appropriate fork of Unitystation.

Step 9: Once selected, it will detect your edited file and allow you to commence submitting the Pull Request (PR). If it states, "Able to merge" then you are a-okay. Be sure to keep "Allow edits from maintainers" ticked, because it allows everyone to work collaboratively on Unitystation's development. Isn't teamwork fun?

Step 10: Be very sure to look over these questions and answer them truthfully and entirely. It directly impacts development on Unitystation and wrongly answering can cause a lot of confusion down the line. Once you're done with this part, be sure to click "Create Pull Request" to finalize the pull request.

Step 11: Once you've submitted your Pull Request, the final result should look like this! Congratulations, you're now a part of history. Side note: If you mess up and need to alter your Pull Request, you can Edit it and Close it on the same page.
