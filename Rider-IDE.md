## Intro
When developing for Unitystation, you will come across a lot IDE's (integrated development environment's), the primary ones will be:
- Mono
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- Rider

The stock IDE for Unity, Mono, is easy to use but lacks certain features that other IDE's have. For this reason, most users choose either Microsoft Visual Studio or Rider.

## Support
The project administrative staff, all use the same IDE: Rider. In our opinion it has the best performance, most features and best cross-platform compatibility. This also means our administrative staff, should all be able to help you out with using Rider.

For use with Rider we also supply a custom coding stylesheet. This XML can be found in the /Tools directory from the project root. Be mindfull that this is not included in the project itself, as the solution file is gitignored.

Although some IDE's may include an automated code cleaner, codecleaning PR's are only accepted from administrative staff, as it is not a 100% automated thing. Those PR's will, however, be done weekly. So there shouldn't be a need to anyway ;)
