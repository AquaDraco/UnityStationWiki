## Intro
For some questions or issues you may want to get in contact with one of the heads of staff directly. However please note that a lot of the administration staff have real life jobs/commitments as well and may not be able to respond in a timely manner (or at all). For that reason it is preferable to ask questions directly on the public discord channel, as most of the time other people there have the needed answers. 

## When to contact the admin team privately
For the following circumstances, direct contact may be preferred:

* Complaints in regards to our Code of Conduct
* Questions from the press
* Legal issues, including, but not limited to, TakeDown notices
* Communication including personal information
* Acquisition and sponsorship

In the following cases any direct personal communication attempts will be ignored and may be considered ban-able:
* Asking to full-fill a empty spot on the administrative or moderation staff.
* Spam, including but not limited to "Can you promote my, product/service/server?"

### Code of Conduct complaints
All Code of Conduct related complaints about a contributor or moderator can be forwarded to the HoP. In case he or she is too involved, the Captain takes on the complaint. When a complaint has no satisfactory result, one can ask the Captain for a second opinion. He/She can reject the second opinion without further reasoning.

In case of CoC complaint against an Admin, the Captain takes on the complaint. No Second opinion is possible in that case. 

In case of a CoC complaint against the Captain, the HoP takes on the complaint and either rejects the complaint or proposes a sanction. The sanction then needs to be accepted by all administrative staff-members and moderators.

_Note: CoC complaints can only be filed for cases involving the community directly, hearsay or issues out of the community will be rejected._
