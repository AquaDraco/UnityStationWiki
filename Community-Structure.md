## Intro
At Unitystation, we like to be as transparent as possible. Although while being transparent, we also have a limited number of contributors with administrative responsibilities to steer the ship in the right direction.

For some questions or issues you (or the organisation you represent) may want to get in contact with one of the administrative staff-members directly. We however are quite busy bees, as we try to actually contribute to the project and have a real life/job too. For that reason we prefer if ask questions directly on the public discord, as most of the time more people have the needed answers. 

## When to contact us privately
For the following circumstances, direct contact may be preferred:

* Complaints in regards to our Code of Conduct
* Questions from the press.
* Legal issues, including, but not limited to, TakeDown notices.
* Communication including personal information
* Acquisition and sponsorship

In the following cases we **do not** want any direct personal communication attempts, any attempts will be ignored and are considered ban-able:
* Asking to full-fill a empty spot on the administrative or moderation staff.
* Spam, including but not limited to "Can you promote my, product/service/server?"

### Code of Conduct complains
All Code of Conduct related complaints about a contributor or moderator can be forwarded to the HoP. In case he or she is too involved, the Captain takes on the complaint. When a complaint has no satisfactory result, one can ask the captain for a second opinion. He/She can reject the second opinion without further reasoning.

In case of CoC complaint agains an Admin, the Captain takes on the complaint. No Second opinion is possible in that case. 

In case of a CoC complaint agains the captain, the HoP takes in your complaint and either rejects the complaint outright or proposes a sanction. The sanction then needs to be accepted by all administrative staff-members and moderators.

_Note: CoC complaints can only be filed for cases involving the community directly, hearsay or issues out of the community will be rejected outright._

Any staff-member is free to give or not make their personal contact details public, unless said postion is directly responsible for legal or press contact requests.
