## This guide is meant for version 0.2.2 and not the current release

## Intro
These are all the mobs! They're dumb, and are basically only useful for one thing, [STEAKS](https://github.com/unitystation/unitystation/wiki/Healing).

## Mobs
### Pete
The chef's mortal enemy, you'll be doing him a favour by killing this goat.
### Runtime
I hope you like cat meat, because medical won't be happy about this..
### Ian
You're a monster if you even think about killing Ian!
### Punpun
The barman's sidekick, these two have formed an unbreakable bond over the years, but you can always kill one of them.. Or both for all we care!
