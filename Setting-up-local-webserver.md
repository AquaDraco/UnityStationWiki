## Intro
UnityStation is a firm believe in OpenSource development, for that reason even our website is a community project. One thing should be noted however: The current host does not include any form of database server.

The first step would be to setup a local webserver, this can be used to preview the current website.

## OSX 
* Download and install mamp from here: 

* Go to "Preferences" Then to "Webserver" and click the small map-with-dots icon.

* Select the following folder from your git checkout of Unity station: /Website/httpdocs

You can now start working from the Git directory and push any changes the same way as you would push changes to the game itself.
