This guide will focus on adding prefabs to tile palettes and using the LevelBrush to modify/create a tilemap.

* For this step the `AirLock` tile has been removed. We can add it back by selecting the arrow in the toolbar, then clicking `Edit`, then selecting the empty tile space and finally selecting the `AirLock` tile in the Inspector:

Remember to deselect `Edit` once the tile has been added to ensure the palette is finalized.
