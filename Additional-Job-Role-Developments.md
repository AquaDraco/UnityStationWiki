## Overview:

Some additional roles will need to be developed to a basic enough standard to support the operation of the station:

* The Janitor will be able to clean up blood and pick up trash with the trash bags.
* Medical staff will be required to clone the dead (as respawn will be disabled) and heal the injured with the bruise packs and burn ointment
* Head of Personnel will have a job adjusting roles and giving additional access to balance the operation state of the Station
