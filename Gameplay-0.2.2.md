## Intro
A an introduction on how to play the current version of Unitystation!

## Controls
Most interactions are done with your mouse, and sometimes depends on your **active hand** (more on that in the coming section).

* The moving character is done with the **arrows keys**, or **WASD** (If you have an AZERTY keyboard, you currently need to switch up your keyboard settings on the windows language panel to a language that uses QWERTY to be able to use **ZQSD**)

* Attacking is done by **left-clicking** on the general direction of someone if you have a ranged weapon, but directly at them if you have a melee weapon.

* Reloading is done by pressing **R**, and it depends on your active hand, so if you have a magazine in your active hand, and a gun in your inactive one, pressing **R** will reload said gun, but the opposite will eject your current magazine and shooting an empty gun will auto-eject the magazine for you.

* Speaking is done by pressing **T**, you can choose where to speak by clicking any or multiple option/s in the pop-up window.

* Examining is done by **right clicking** any item on your screen, you'll see a message in the chat describing the item. 

* Pulling an object, item, mob or player is done by pressing **C** while hovering what/who you want to pull _(Doesn't currently work)_.

* **Alt-clicking** while hovering your cursor on a tile is used to show all objects on a single tile, which facilitates picking up an item from a pile _(Only works in the interaction range of your character)_.

## Interaction with Objects
To interact with doors, window doors and crates, you have to **left-click **on them, but to interact with items, you need to keep your hand slots in mind:

The slot with the outline is the **active hand**, and the other is the **inactive hand**, and it dictactes if you're using the hand or not, 
So if you have an item in your **active hand**, you'll be using that item, by either attacking with it, or putting on a table/crate, but if it's empty, you'll be able to pick up items on the ground and in your other inventory slots.
