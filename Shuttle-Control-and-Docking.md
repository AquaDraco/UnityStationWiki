## Intro
Unitystation, will implement a seperate matrix for shuttles and other seperate-from-station objects.
This means that those objects can move on their own, while keeping the relative position of objects in on it.

## Shuttle control In system
Controllable shuttles, can be controller by entering the pilots chair and using the navigational computer. They will be controllable by the controls that are usually used to move the player.

## Moving to another system
Moving to another system, the emergency shuttle to centcom for example, happens by setting the destination in the navigational computer, moving far enough from the station, preparing jump (click) and clicking jump-now

Jump will seem like a bright flash on the outside and the inside matrix will be moved to a "In transit" scene and jump out to the destination scene with the same bright flash afterwards.

if obstructed it will jump out on another non-obstructed jumpout point.

## Landing
Landing will happen by moving the shuttle to the plannet position, preparing-landing and clicking "Initiate Landing". with a firey flash the shuttle will disappear. for insiders an "deorbit" scene will be displayed after which the shuttle will land on the surface.

Prior to shuttle land (at the same time of the deorbit scene on the shuttle) the landing spot will darken, as if it is a shadow. Anything there will be obliterated
