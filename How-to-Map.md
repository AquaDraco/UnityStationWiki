### This page is already changed for the upcoming Tile Map System (tms) and is currently only usable in the Tilemap_Overhault branch

## Mapping Quick Guide

To access the mapping tool go to Window --> Palette

From here you can select a palette with tiles and multiple tools, like a placement tool (brush), a square fill tool (square) or a deletion tool (gum).

The Map Editor will create the child GameObjects (walls, floors, doors, tables etc) in the right categories automatically and place the tiles accordingly. 

Tiles are added to the palettes as they are created. To create a new Tile follow this example:

### Example: Adding a new object

- Choose a tile from /Tilemaps/Tiles/Objects
- Drag a tile to a palette

### Pull Requests

Almost never would you need to actually PR a palette change, if you do please make sure NOT to include anything other than the palette file and its .meta file.
